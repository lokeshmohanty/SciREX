# SciREX Experimental

Computational research and experimental implementations for Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and Scientific Computing.

## Key Features

- **Rapid Prototyping**: Area for testing new ideas and architectures before they are stabilized.
- **Interoperability**: Experimental support for TensorFlow and PyTorch workflows.
- **Scientific ML**: Advanced components for PINNs, DeepONets, and other SciML methods.
